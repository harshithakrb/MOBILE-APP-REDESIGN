***Task 3: MOBILE APP REDESIGN***

For Task 3, I worked on designing a Netflix-inspired UI prototype in Figma, focusing on an interactive and immersive user experience. The objective was to create a visually engaging mobile app UI, ensuring smooth navigation between different screens while maintaining a realistic prototype flow.

This project involved:

Designing multiple screens representing different user interactions.
Implementing UI/UX principles to enhance user engagement.
Creating a clickable prototype for a seamless flow between pages.
Ensuring a responsive, visually aesthetic design that aligns with Netflix's brand.

**1. Planning and Wireframing**
Before diving into high-fidelity designs, I first planned out the screen sequence and user interactions. The key screens designed include:

Logo Page: Displays the Netflix logo with a simple splash screen animation effect.
Login Page: Features user profile selection for multiple accounts.
Home Page: Displays featured content, previews, and a "Continue Watching" section.
Loading Screen: Includes an animated loading effect for a seamless transition.
Profile Page: Allows users to manage their profiles and access account settings.
Play Screen: A detailed media player interface with playback controls.
Copied Screen: Represents a confirmation page for sharing content.
After sketching out the flow, I moved on to designing these screens in Figma, ensuring consistency in layout, colors, typography, and user interactions.

**2. UI Design and Styling in Figma**
Color Palette and Typography
Used Netflixâ€™s signature colors: black, red, and white to maintain brand identity.
Applied bold typography to highlight important elements like titles and buttons.
Layout and Component Design
Created reusable components for buttons, navigation bars, and profile icons.
Ensured a structured and visually balanced layout with proper spacing.
Used drop shadows and gradients to enhance visual appeal.

**3. Prototyping in Figma**
After finalizing the UI, I implemented interactive prototyping in Figma to make the design clickable and navigable.

Prototype Interactions
Logo Page â†’ Login Page (auto-transition with a delay).
Login Page â†’ Home Page (profile selection click triggers page transition).
Home Page â†’ Play Screen (clicking on a movie thumbnail opens the player).
Profile Icon â†’ Profile Page (tap interaction for quick access).
Play Screen â†’ Back to Home (exit button interaction).
These interactions ensure a smooth, real-time experience for testing and user feedback.

**4. Testing and Refinements**
To validate the design, I performed multiple rounds of testing:

Checked responsiveness for different screen sizes.
Tested prototype flow to ensure logical navigation.
Refined animations and transitions for a natural user experience.
Optimized UI elements for better readability and accessibility.

**Final Outcome**
The completed Netflix UI prototype in Figma is a fully interactive, visually appealing, and user-friendly design that accurately represents a real-world streaming platform experience. It provides smooth navigation, high usability, and a strong aesthetic appeal, ensuring an engaging and immersive experience for users. ðŸš€
